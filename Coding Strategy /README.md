To build ClearView, the architecture and repo structure should be modular and scalable to accommodate different components such as AI, anonymization, backend, frontend, and analytics. Below is a proposed **repository structure** for ClearView's architecture:

### 1. **Top-Level Structure**

```
clearview/
│
├── backend/              # Backend services and APIs
├── frontend/             # Frontend application code
├── ai-services/          # AI models, job matching, and anonymization
├── data/                 # Data models, databases, and migration scripts
├── analytics/            # Analytics service for reports and bias detection
├── devops/               # CI/CD, Kubernetes, Docker, and infrastructure as code
├── docs/                 # Documentation
├── tests/                # Unit and integration tests
├── config/               # Configuration files (environment variables, API keys, etc.)
└── scripts/              # Utility scripts
```

### 2. **Detailed Structure**

#### 2.1 **Backend (`backend/`)**
Handles API endpoints, business logic, user authentication, and service integration. Built using **Node.js/Express** or **Python/Django/Flask**, depending on tech preference.

```
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/          # API endpoints and route controllers
│   ├── services/             # Core business logic and service classes
│   ├── models/               # Database models and schemas
│   ├── middlewares/          # Authentication, authorization, and validation middleware
│   ├── utils/                # Utility functions (logging, error handling, etc.)
│   └── routes/               # API route definitions
├── app.js                    # Application entry point
└── package.json              # Backend dependencies and scripts
```

**Backend services:**
- **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication, RBAC, and session management.
- **Candidate Service**: Manages job seeker profiles, resumes, and applications.
- **Employer Service**: Manages job postings and employer-related functionality.
- **Interview Service**: Schedules interviews, handles surveys, and feedback collection.
- **Analytics Service**: Communicates with the analytics microservice for generating reports.

#### 2.2 **Frontend (`frontend/`)**
Handles the user interface for job seekers, employers, and admins. Built using **React.js** or **Vue.js** with a component-based architecture.

```
frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── pages/                # Page-level components (e.g., job postings, profile view)
│   ├── services/             # API calls to backend services
│   ├── state/                # State management (e.g., Redux or Vuex)
│   ├── assets/               # Static files like images, fonts, etc.
│   └── utils/                # Helper functions and constants
├── public/                   # Public HTML files
├── package.json              # Frontend dependencies and scripts
└── webpack.config.js         # Webpack configuration for building the frontend
```

**Frontend features:**
- **Dashboard**: For both job seekers and employers.
- **Resume Upload**: For candidates to upload and view anonymized resumes.
- **Job Matching**: Displays job postings with similarity scores for candidates.
- **Interview Feedback**: Enables candidates and interviewers to fill out feedback surveys.

#### 2.3 **AI Services (`ai-services/`)**
Houses all AI and ML functionalities such as resume parsing, job matching, and bias detection. Can be built with **Python** (using frameworks like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** for machine learning models).

```
ai-services/
├── models/                  # Pretrained models for job matching, anonymization, and feedback analysis
├── pipelines/               # ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines for training data
├── resume-parsing/          # Code for parsing resumes and generating S.M.A.R.T goals
├── job-matching/            # Job matching algorithms based on qualifications and requirements
├── bias-detection/          # AI algorithms for identifying potential bias in hiring practices
├── model-serving/           # Code for serving models via APIs (e.g., Flask, FastAPI)
└── requirements.txt         # Dependencies for AI services
```

**AI features:**
- **Resume Anonymization**: Strips identifiable information like name, gender, and age.
- **Job Matching**: Uses natural language processing (NLP) to align job descriptions with candidate qualifications.
- **Bias Detection**: Analyzes patterns in hiring data for bias in selection processes.
  
#### 2.4 **Data (`data/`)**
Handles all the databases, data models, and migration scripts.

```
data/
├── migrations/               # Database migration files (e.g., Flyway, Alembic)
├── models/                   # ORM models (e.g., Sequelize, SQLAlchemy)
├── seeds/                    # Seed data for initial database population
└── database_config.js        # Database connection settings (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
```

**Databases**:
- **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**: For storing candidate profiles, job postings, and interview feedback.
- **NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB)**: For storing unstructured data like feedback text or resume analysis.

#### 2.5 **Analytics (`analytics/`)**
Handles data aggregation, KPI reporting, and bias analysis using data visualization and statistical tools. Technologies like **Python** with **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, or **Plotly** could be used.

```
analytics/
├── src/
│   ├── reports/              # Scripts for generating monthly hiring reports
│   ├── data-aggregation/     # Services for aggregating hiring and demographic data
│   ├── visualization/        # Visualization of bias detection and other analytics
└── requirements.txt          # Dependencies for analytics
```

#### 2.6 **DevOps (`devops/`)**
Contains infrastructure as code (IaC), CI/CD pipelines, and containerization configurations. Built with **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **CI/CD tools** like **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, or **CircleCI**.

```
devops/
├── docker/                   # Docker configuration files for containerization

├── terraform/                # Infrastructure as code using Terraform for cloud resources
└── monitoring/               # Monitoring and logging configurations (e.g., Prometheus, ELK Stack)
```

#### 2.7 **Docs (`docs/`)**
Contains project documentation, API specifications, and onboarding guides.

```

├── user-manual/              # User guides for job seekers, employers, and admins
└── architecture.md           # High-level system architecture documentation
```

#### 2.8 **Tests (`tests/`)**
Houses unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests for backend, frontend, and AI services.

```
tests/
├── unit/                     # Unit tests for backend and AI services
├── integration/              # Integration tests for API services

└── test-config.js            # Testing configuration (e.g., Jest, Mocha)
```

#### 2.9 **Config (`config/`)**
Stores configuration files for different environments (development, testing, production).

```
config/
├── dev.env                   # Development environment variables
├── prod.env                  # Production environment variables
└── test.env                  # Test environment variables
```

#### 2.10 **Scripts (`scripts/`)**
Contains utility scripts for database seeding, deployment, and maintenance tasks.

```
scripts/
├── seed-db.sh                # Script to seed the database
├── deploy.sh                 # Script to deploy the platform to production
└── migrate.sh                # Script to run database migrations
```

### **Overall System Design Flow**

1. **User Interaction (Frontend)**:
   - Job seekers upload resumes.
   - Employers post job openings.
   - Both parties interact with dashboards and receive AI-driven insights.

2. **Backend (API Layer)**:
   - Handles user requests, communicates with AI services for resume anonymization and matching, manages job postings, and stores data.

3. **AI Services**:
   - Parse resumes, anonymize candidate data, generate S.M.A.R.T goals, and match jobs.
   - Perform bias detection on aggregated feedback and hiring data.

4. **Data Aggregation and Analytics**:
   - Collects feedback from interviews, hiring decisions, and demographic data to generate reports.
   - Provides monthly reports with KPIs and insights on potential biases.

5. **DevOps**:
   - Containerizes services with Docker, deploys using Kubernetes, and monitors system health using Prometheus/ELK Stack.

This repo structure allows for modular development and scalability, ensuring each component can evolve independently.
