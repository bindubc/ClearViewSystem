### **Fitness Functions for ClearView Architecture**

A fitness function is a quantitative measure or set of metrics used to evaluate whether the architecture is meeting the desired characteristics and requirements. For ClearView, the fitness functions will ensure that the system satisfies critical driving characteristics like availability, performance, security, scalability, and maintainability.

Below are the fitness functions that correspond to ClearView’s goals and business objectives:

---

### **1. Availability Fitness Functions**
   - **Metric**: Uptime Percentage
   - **Target**: 99.99% availability for core services such as **API Gateway**, **Job Management**, and **Candidate Profile Service**.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**: 
     - Track service uptime using monitoring tools like **Prometheus** or **AWS CloudWatch**.
     - Measure response times for API Gateway and critical microservices to ensure they meet SLA requirements.
   - **Implementation**: Use synthetic tests to simulate user requests periodically and monitor service response.

---

### **2. Performance Fitness Functions**
   - **Metric**: Response Time and Throughput
   - **Target**: 
     - API response time < 200ms for read operations.
     - < 500ms for complex queries (e.g., AI Matching Engine).
     - Throughput of 1000 concurrent users for Web Application.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**:
     - Use **JMeter** or **Gatling** to test load and stress for different components.
     - Monitor latency using **New Relic** or **Datadog**.
   - **Implementation**: Run performance tests during continuous integration (CI) and deployment pipelines to detect bottlenecks.

---

### **3. Security Fitness Functions**
   - **Metric**: Vulnerability and Risk Score
   - **Target**: Zero critical or high vulnerabilities in **IAM Service**, **API Gateway**, and **Notification Service**.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**:
     - Use tools like **OWASP ZAP** or **Snyk** to perform automated scans.
     - Ensure compliance with **GDPR** and **EEOC** standards for anonymization and data handling.
   - **Implementation**: Integrate security scans in CI/CD pipelines and review logs for unauthorized access.

---

### **4. Scalability Fitness Functions**
   - **Metric**: Horizontal and Vertical Scalability Capability
   - **Target**: Scale to handle 10x growth in users and data size without performance degradation.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**:
     - Use **Kubernetes** or **AWS ECS** to scale services like **AI Matching Engine**, **Data Aggregation**, and **Job Management Service**.
     - Track auto-scaling triggers and response times.
   - **Implementation**: Load testing with **Chaos Monkey** to simulate scaling scenarios and validate elasticity.

---

### **5. Maintainability Fitness Functions**
   - **Metric**: Code Complexity and Deployment Frequency
   - **Target**: Maintain **Cyclomatic Complexity** < 10 for all critical microservices.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**:
     - Use **SonarQube** to measure code quality and maintainability.
     - Measure the frequency of successful deployments per week.
   - **Implementation**: Use automated testing frameworks and ensure deployment pipelines are streamlined.

---

### **6. Compliance and Anonymization Fitness Functions**
   - **Metric**: Compliance Score and Anonymization Coverage
   - **Target**: 100% compliance for anonymization of candidate profiles until unlocked by employers.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**:
     - Use data anonymization tools to remove any identifiable information.
     - Implement compliance audits for DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) standards.
   - **Implementation**: Regular audits and use tools like **DataDog** for compliance monitoring.

---

### **7. Integration Fitness Functions**
   - **Metric**: Integration Success Rate
   - **Target**: 95% successful sync between ClearView and external HR systems (e.g., Greenhouse, Workday).
   - **Evaluation Criteria**:
     - Track error rates in the **Integration Gateway**.
     - Ensure data consistency using **CDC (Change Data Capture)** methods.
   - **Implementation**: Test integration workflows with mock data and validate sync status.

---

### **8. AI Matching Engine Accuracy Fitness Functions**
   - **Metric**: Matching Accuracy and Model Precision
   - **Target**: Achieve > 85% accuracy for candidate-job matching based on S.M.A.R.T goals.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**:
     - Use **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score** to evaluate the model’s effectiveness.
     - A/B testing for different algorithm versions.
   - **Implementation**: Continuous monitoring using ML model evaluation tools like **MLFlow**.

---

### **9. Usability Fitness Functions**
   - **Metric**: User Satisfaction Score
   - **Target**: > 90% positive feedback from users for the Web Application.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**:
     - Measure user experience using **CSAT** (Customer Satisfaction) surveys and **NPS** (Net Promoter Score).
     - Monitor user activity to detect any common pain points.
   - **Implementation**: Conduct usability tests and implement feedback loops for continuous improvement.

---

### **10. Notification and Messaging Fitness Functions**
   - **Metric**: Message Delivery Success Rate
   - **Target**: 99.95% success rate for all notifications (Email, SMS, In-App).
   - **Evaluation Criteria**:
     - Use tools like **Twilio** or **AWS SNS** to track message delivery rates.
     - Ensure real-time delivery for interview updates and alerts.
   - **Implementation**: Automated monitoring of notification queues and retry mechanisms for failed deliveries.
