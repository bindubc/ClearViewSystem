# ClearView - Transparent Decision Making: HR Platform to Reduce Hiring Bias

### Overview

ClearView is an AI-powered, supplemental HR platform that anonymizes candidate information, emphasizing objective skills and qualifying experiences to reduce bias in the hiring process. It also supports DEI consultants who shadow employer interviews to assess interviewer behavior and report findings, ensuring an equitable hiring environment.

ClearView's HR platform leverages AI to construct personalized, data-driven candidate stories aligned with SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) goals. It anonymizes personal identifiers (e.g., race, lifestyle) until a decision based on qualifications is made. Hiring companies can unlock profiles after objective selection, and aggregated data highlights disparities between those hired and those rejected.


### Key Features and Requirements


* __AI-Powered Resume Reconstruction__: Resumes are converted into SMART goal-based summaries and matched against job descriptions using a similarity score.
* __AI Tips for Resume Improvement__: Automated suggestions to help job seekers optimize their resumes for better alignment with job postings.
* __Anonymization__ : AI eliminates identifiers that may introduce bias, ensuring decisions are based on skills and experience.
* __Data Aggregation and Analysis__: Provides insights into disparities in hiring decisions and generates monthly KPI reports.

### Problem Statements
* __Lack of Impactful Metrics__: Identifying and reducing bias in the candidate hiring and interview process is challenging, as current systems lack actionable data to measure and address bias effectively.
* __Ineffective ATS__: Traditional applicant tracking systems often redundantly fail to match viable candidates to job descriptions, resulting in missed opportunities and inefficient hiring.
