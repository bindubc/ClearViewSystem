The Diversity Cyber Council is a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing diversity and inclusion within the tech industry. Its primary focus is on underrepresented demographics, aiming to provide them with access to education, training, and job placement opportunities. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its key components:

- __Purpose__ : The council serves groups that are often underrepresented in tech, helping them gain the skills and opportunities necessary to thrive in the workforce.

- __Vision__: Their broader aim is to foster greater inclusion and representation in the tech industry. They do this through initiatives such as:

    * Training programs
    * Mentoring support
    * Networking opportunities
    * Visibility campaigns
- __Goal__: Their main objective is to create a lasting, diverse talent pipeline. This is done by offering effective training programs that lead to direct employment, providing individuals from marginalized communities with equitable access to tech careers.

By focusing on these areas, the Diversity Cyber Council seeks to ensure more inclusive participation in the tech sector, helping to close the diversity gap in the industry.
