Here’s a proposed database schema for the **Anonymization Service** that focuses on anonymizing candidate data while maintaining the necessary relationships and functionalities:

### Database Schema for Anonymization Service

#### 1. Candidate Table
Stores basic information about candidates before anonymization.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Candidates (
    candidate_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    phone_number VARCHAR(15),
    resume TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. Anonymized Candidate Table
Holds the anonymized data of candidates.

```sql
CREATE TABLE AnonymizedCandidates (
    anonymized_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    candidate_id UUID REFERENCES Candidates(candidate_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    anonymized_name VARCHAR(200),  -- Could be a generated name or pseudonym
    anonymized_email VARCHAR(255),
    anonymized_phone VARCHAR(15),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 3. Anonymization Log Table
Tracks the anonymization process, including timestamps and actions taken.

```sql
CREATE TABLE AnonymizationLogs (
    log_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    candidate_id UUID REFERENCES Candidates(candidate_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    anonymized_id UUID REFERENCES AnonymizedCandidates(anonymized_id),
    action VARCHAR(50),  -- e.g., "Anonymized", "Restored"
    status VARCHAR(50),  -- e.g., "Success", "Failed"
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 4. Job Applications Table
Stores information about job applications made by candidates, linking them to their anonymized profiles.

```sql
CREATE TABLE JobApplications (
    application_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    candidate_id UUID REFERENCES Candidates(candidate_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    job_id UUID,
    application_status VARCHAR(50),
    applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Relationships
- **Candidates** to **AnonymizedCandidates**: A one-to-one relationship where each candidate has one anonymized profile.
- **Candidates** to **AnonymizationLogs**: A one-to-many relationship where each candidate can have multiple logs of their anonymization actions.
- **Candidates** to **JobApplications**: A one-to-many relationship where each candidate can apply for multiple jobs.

### Example of Usage
1. When a candidate profile is created, it gets stored in the **Candidates** table.
2. When the candidate's profile is anonymized, a new entry is created in the **AnonymizedCandidates** table, and an entry is logged in the **AnonymizationLogs** table to record the action.
3. Job applications made by the candidate will reference the candidate’s original ID, ensuring that all applications remain linked to the right candidate even after anonymization.

### Additional Considerations
- **Data Security**: Ensure that sensitive fields like email and phone numbers are encrypted.
- **Auditing**: Implement triggers to log changes and actions for compliance purposes.
- **Data Retention**: Define a policy for how long anonymized data should be kept, as well as how to handle deletion requests in compliance with regulations like GDPR.

This schema provides a comprehensive structure to support the functionalities of the Anonymization Service while maintaining data integrity and relationships among components.
