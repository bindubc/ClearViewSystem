### **ADR-003: Data Storage Selection**
- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** October 5, 2024

#### **Context:**
ClearView handles structured data (e.g., user profiles, job postings) and unstructured data (e.g., resumes, feedback documents). Choosing appropriate storage solutions is critical to meet performance, consistency, and compliance requirements.

#### **Evaluation Criteria:**
- Data type support: Handling structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- Performance: Query speed and data retrieval time.
- Compliance: GDPR and EEOC compliance for data privacy and protection.
- Scalability: Ability to handle increasing data volumes without performance degradation.

#### **Options:**
1. **Relational Database Service (RDS)**
   - Pros:
     - Strong consistency guarantees.
     - ACID transactions for critical data.
     - Support for advanced querying.
   - Cons:
     - Limited scalability compared to NoSQL solutions.

2. **NoSQL (DynamoDB)**
   - Pros:
     - High read and write throughput.
     - Flexible schema for storing varied data types.
     - Horizontal scaling.
   - Cons:
     - Eventual consistency for some operations.

3. **Document Storage (S3)**
   - Pros:
     - Ideal for storing large, unstructured files.
     - Cost-effective and scalable.
   - Cons:
     - Slower access times for frequent queries.

#### **Decision:**
A combination of RDS for structured data, DynamoDB for semi-structured data, and S3 for document storage was chosen to balance consistency, performance, and scalability needs.

#### **Implications:**
- Positive: Optimized data storage tailored to specific use cases, compliance with data retention policies.
- Negative: Increased operational complexity in managing multiple storage types.

#### **Consultation:**
- Input from data engineers and compliance officers to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.
