 **ADR-001: Choice of Microservices Architecture**
   - **Status**: Decided
   - **Context**: The need for scalability, independent deployability, and the ability to manage complex functionalities across teams.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**: 
     - **Scalability**: Handle increased load efficiently.
     - **Maintainability**: Ease of updating and deploying services independently.
     - **Team Autonomy**: Teams can own and manage their services.
   - **Options**: 
     - **Monolithic architecture**: Simpler initial deployment but challenging to scale.
     - **Microservices**: More complex but provides flexibility and scalability.
   - **Decision**: Adopt microservices architecture.
   - **Implications**: Increased complexity in service management and orchestration.
   - **Failover Strategy**: Implement circuit breakers and service discovery mechanisms (e.g., Eureka, Consul) to ensure service resilience.
   - **Resolution for Issues**: Develop comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to proactively manage service failures.
   - **Consultation**: DevOps team, senior architects.
