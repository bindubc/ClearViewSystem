# 006 - Algorithm Selection for ClearView Features

## Status
Decided

## Context
ClearView aims to enhance the hiring process through AI-powered features such as resume reconstruction, candidate analytics, and bias detection. The choice of algorithms plays a crucial role in ensuring these features are effective, accurate, and compliant with regulations. The challenge is to select the right algorithms that align with the system's goals while maintaining performance, scalability, and fairness.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Effectiveness:** The algorithm should effectively achieve the desired outcomes (e.g., accurate resume matching, bias detection).
- **Scalability:** The algorithm must handle varying data loads as the number of users and resumes increases.
- **Performance:** The algorithm should operate within acceptable response times to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Fairness:** Algorithms must minimize bias and ensure equitable treatment of candidates.
- **Compliance:** Algorithms must adhere to legal standards (e.g., GDPR, EEOC).

## Options
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Algorithms**
   - **Pros:** Strong capability for processing and understanding text; effective for resume analysis.
   - **Cons:** Requires significant computational resources.

2. **Machine Learning Classification Algorithms**
   - **Pros:** Can adapt and improve based on historical data; effective for providing recommendations.
   - **Cons:** Potential for bias in training data; requires continuous monitoring.

3. **Data Anonymization Techniques (e.g., K-Anonymity)**
   - **Pros:** Helps in protecting candidate privacy; supports compliance with data protection regulations.
   - **Cons:** May reduce data utility if not implemented carefully.

4. **Statistical Analysis and Reporting Algorithms**
   - **Pros:** Useful for generating insights from hiring data; helps in compliance reporting.
   - **Cons:** May not provide real-time insights if heavily dependent on batch processing.

## Decision
Adopt a hybrid approach using a combination of NLP algorithms for resume analysis, machine learning classification algorithms for recommendations, and data anonymization techniques to ensure compliance and fairness. This approach balances effectiveness with compliance and performance considerations.

## Implications
- **Positive:** Enhanced ability to provide personalized recommendations, improve resume matching, and detect bias in hiring practices.
- **Negative:** Increased complexity in implementation and the need for ongoing algorithm monitoring and updates to mitigate bias.
