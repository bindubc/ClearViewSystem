**# ADR-007: High Availability Strategy for ClearView Platform**

## Status
**Draft**

## Context
High Availability (HA) is a critical requirement for ClearView due to its role as a hiring and recruitment platform that needs to be accessible to multiple stakeholders, including candidates, employers, and DEI consultants. The platform’s continuous availability ensures seamless operations and positive user experiences. The system must handle potential failures with minimal service disruption, supporting functionalities such as resume processing, analytics, and compliance reporting.

### Requirements for HA:
1. **Minimal Downtime:** Any planned or unplanned downtime should be within acceptable limits (e.g., 99.99% availability).
2. **Failover Capabilities:** Ability to switch to a redundant system in case of failure.
3. **Scalability and Load Management:** Handle varying loads efficiently, without performance degradation.
4. **Redundancy:** Redundant components for critical services to avoid single points of failure.
5. **Resiliency:** Recover from system failures quickly, while preserving data integrity.
6. **Data Consistency:** Ensure no data loss or corruption during failover.

### Drivers for Decision:
- **User Experience Impact:** Downtime or performance issues could result in a poor experience for candidates and employers.
- **Business Continuity:** Critical business operations must continue even during server or network failures.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Legal and compliance requirements, such as GDPR, may require data and service continuity.

## Evaluation Criteria
The HA strategy must consider the following aspects:
- **Scalability:** Must support horizontal scaling as the platform grows.
- **Cost Efficiency:** The architecture should be cost-effective, balancing redundancy and operational expenses.
- **Failover Speed:** System should recover within a few seconds to minutes.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring data consistency during transitions is crucial.
- **Performance Impact:** HA solutions should not degrade the overall system performance.

## Options
### Option 1: **Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) Deployment in AWS**
- **Description:** Deploy ClearView components (such as application servers, database clusters, and storage) across multiple Availability Zones within a region.
- **Benefits:**
  - Automatic failover between zones for critical components.
  - Low latency within zones ensures optimal performance.
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Higher cost due to duplication of resources.
  - May require complex configurations for certain components.

### Option 2: **Active-Passive Failover Setup**
- **Description:** Maintain an active instance for each service and a passive standby instance that is activated in case of failure.
- **Benefits:**
  - Easier to manage and implement.
  - Lower operational costs than active-active setups.
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Increased recovery time compared to active-active.
  - Standby resources remain idle, leading to inefficient use of resources.

### Option 3: **Active-Active Deployment**
- **Description:** All instances are active and share the load; failover is handled by rerouting traffic.
- **Benefits:**
  - Zero downtime during failover.
  - All resources are utilized effectively.
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Increased complexity in implementation and coordination.
  - Requires sophisticated load balancing and session management.

## Decision
**Option 1: Multi-AZ Deployment in AWS** is chosen for ClearView due to its balance of reliability, performance, and failover capabilities. AWS’s built-in tools for HA management, such as RDS Multi-AZ, S3 replication, and ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) for automatic failover, align with ClearView’s requirements.

### Justification:
- **Reliability:** Multi-AZ deployment ensures continuous availability, even during zone-level outages.
- **Performance:** Low latency between zones.
- **Scalability:** Easy to scale horizontally within and across zones.
- **Resiliency:** Redundant components in separate zones reduce the risk of system-wide failures.
- **AWS Integration:** Leverages AWS’s managed services to simplify HA management, reducing operational overhead.

## Implications
### Positive
- Higher availability and reduced downtime.
- Seamless failover and disaster recovery.
- Improved user experience and trust in the platform.

### Negative
- Increased cost due to duplication of critical components.
- Complex configuration and management across zones.

## Failover Considerations
- Use **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** to direct traffic to healthy instances.
- Implement **RDS Multi-AZ** for database failover.
- Leverage **Route 53** for DNS-based failover to route traffic to a healthy region if one region becomes entirely unavailable.

## Resolutions for Issues
1. **Issue: Increased Costs of Redundant Systems**
   - **Solution:** Implement on-demand scaling to activate secondary resources only when needed.

2. **Issue: Failover Latency Impact**
   - **Solution:** Optimize health checks and reduce timeout thresholds for faster failover detection.

3. **Issue: Data Inconsistency during Failover**
   - **Solution:** Use synchronous replication for critical databases to ensure data consistency.

## Consultation
- **Cloud Engineering Team:** Reviewed AWS deployment options.
- **Security Team:** Verified compliance considerations for data replication.
- **DevOps Team:** Provided input on failover automation and CI/CD integration.
