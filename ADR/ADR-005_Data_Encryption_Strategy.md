5. **ADR-005: Data Encryption Strategy**
   - **Status**: Decided
   - **Context**: Compliance requirements for handling personally identifiable information (PII).
   - **Evaluation Criteria**: 
     - **Security**: Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
     - **Performance**: Minimize the impact on application speed and response time.
     - **Compliance**: Adherence to legal and regulatory standards.
   - **Options**:
     - **AES for data at rest and TLS for data in transit**: Comprehensive and robust security measures.
     - **Only encrypt sensitive fields**: Easier implementation but exposes more data.
   - **Decision**: Encrypt all PII using AES; enforce TLS for all communications.
   - **Implications**: Performance overhead but necessary for regulatory compliance.
   - **Failover Strategy**: Implement secure key management practices and regular key rotation to minimize risks.
   - **Resolution for Issues**: Develop fallback mechanisms to access data in case of encryption failures or issues.
   - **Consultation**: Compliance officer, security team.
