4. **ADR-004: Authentication Mechanism**
   - **Status**: Draft
   - **Context**: Requirement for secure user authentication and authorization.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**: 
     - **Security**: Protection against unauthorized access and data breaches.
     - **Ease of Implementation**: Speed of integration into existing systems.
     - **User Experience**: Minimal friction for end-users during authentication.
   - **Options**:
     - **OAuth2**: Widely used, secure, allows third-party access.
     - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Stateless but requires careful management of token expiration and revocation.
   - **Decision**: OAuth.
   - **Implications**: Impact on overall security posture and user experience.
   - **Failover Strategy**: Implement refresh tokens and secure storage of tokens to ensure availability and session continuity.
   - **Resolution for Issues**: Regular security audits and updates to the authentication mechanisms.
   - **Consultation**: Security team, user experience designers.
