### **ADR-008: Caching Strategy**
- **Status:** Decided


#### **Context:**
Caching is essential to improve API performance and reduce the load on primary databases, especially when handling high volumes of candidate and employer profile queries. The cache should ensure data freshness while minimizing latency in response times.

#### **Evaluation Criteria:**
- Low latency data retrieval.
- Support for cache invalidation strategies.
- Ease of integration with existing microservices.
- Data consistency and freshness.

#### **Options:**
1. **In-Memory Cache (Redis)**
   - Pros:
     - Fast read and write operations.
     - Advanced data structures (e.g., lists, sets) for complex caching.
     - Support for both time-based and event-based cache expiration.
   - Cons:
     - Requires additional management and monitoring.

2. **Distributed Cache (Memcached)**
   - Pros:
     - Low memory overhead.
     - Simple key-value storage.
   - Cons:
     - Lacks support for complex data structures and event-driven expiration.

3. **No Cache (Database Query)**
   - Pros:
     - Data is always up-to-date.
   - Cons:
     - Higher latency and increased database load.

#### **Decision:**
Redis was selected due to its ability to handle complex data structures and support for various eviction policies, making it ideal for caching user sessions, job search results, and frequently accessed data.

#### **Implications:**
- Positive: Improved response time for frequently accessed data, reduced database load.
- Negative: Additional component to manage; potential data inconsistency if cache invalidation is not handled properly.

#### **Consultation:**
- Engaged with backend engineering team and data architects to ensure alignment with performance and scalability goals.
