**ADR-010: Selection of Integration System**

**Status:** Decided

**Context:**  
As ClearView scales, we need a robust integration system that facilitates seamless communication between our platform and external services, including third-party applications and legacy systems. The chosen system must support various data formats and protocols, while ensuring low friction for future integrations and updates. A key challenge is balancing flexibility with ease of maintenance, particularly given the mix of modern and legacy systems we must interface with.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Flexibility & Scalability:** The ability to handle a wide range of data formats (e.g., JSON, XML) and protocols (e.g., HTTP, AMQP) is essential. The system must be scalable to handle increased traffic and new integration points over time.
- **Maintainability:** The solution should allow for easy service updates and independent deployments, minimizing potential downtime and dependencies.
- **Ease of Integration:** It should enable third-party systems to integrate with minimal changes, reducing the effort required to onboard new services.
- **Resilience & Monitoring:** Given the complex nature of integrations, the system should include robust monitoring and alerting capabilities to proactively address any issues.

**Options Considered:**
1. **Webhooks and RESTful APIs:** This option offers simplicity, leveraging widely-adopted RESTful practices for integration. It allows third-party apps to connect easily via standard webhooks or APIs, making it relatively simple for modern systems to integrate.
   
   - **Pros:** Simple, quick to implement, easy for modern systems to integrate.
   - **Cons:** Lacks flexibility in handling complex data formats or legacy systems. Difficult to scale for highly heterogeneous environments.
  
2. **Integration Hubs (Apache Camel):** A more sophisticated approach, using an open-source framework like Apache Camel to manage routing, transformations, and integrations with multiple systems. This allows for high flexibility, scalability, and integration with both modern and legacy systems.
   
   - **Pros:** Extremely flexible, supports a wide range of protocols, allows for dynamic routing and transformation of data. Integrates well with legacy systems.
   - **Cons:** More complex to manage and maintain, steeper learning curve, higher setup costs in terms of time and resources.

**Decision:**  
We have chosen to adopt the **Integration Hub architecture using Apache Camel**. This solution provides the flexibility we need to handle a variety of integration scenarios and future-proofs our system by supporting both modern and legacy systems. Despite its complexity, it offers scalability, powerful routing, and transformation capabilities that are crucial for long-term growth.

**Implications:**  
- **Increased complexity** in managing and orchestrating services, requiring a more sophisticated infrastructure setup.
- **Longer setup time** initially, as the team needs to master Apache Camel and design the integration workflows.
- **Higher maintenance overhead** due to the complexity of the hub, especially as more integrations are added over time.

**Mitigation:**  
We will implement robust monitoring, logging, and alerting systems using **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to ensure we can proactively detect and resolve issues before they impact operations. The team will also invest in comprehensive documentation and best practices to ensure maintainability.

**Future Considerations:**  
As the system grows, we may need to adopt additional practices such as **message queuing** (e.g., RabbitMQ) or **event-driven architecture** to further enhance resilience and decouple services.
