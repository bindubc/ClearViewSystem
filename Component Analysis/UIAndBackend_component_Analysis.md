### **1. User Interface Components**

#### **1.1 Registration & Login Module**
**Flow Overview:**
1. **User Registration**  
   - User chooses a role (Employer, Job Candidate, Admin).
   - Fills out registration form based on role.
   - Email/SMS verification step.
   - Redirected to relevant dashboard on successful registration.

2. **User Login**
   - Enters credentials.
   - Optional 2FA for secure login.
   - Session management initiates and user is redirected to their dashboard.

**Limitations:**
- **Security Concerns:** Storing sensitive user data requires strong encryption.
- **Scalability:** High concurrent user registrations may slow down the system.
- **Email/SMS Dependencies:** Reliance on external services can lead to delays.

**Flow Diagram:**
```
User -> Registration Form -> Role Selection -> Verification -> Dashboard
User -> Login Form -> Authentication -> 2FA (if enabled) -> Dashboard
```

**Recommendations:**
- **Implement OAuth:** Allow users to log in using third-party services (e.g., Google, LinkedIn) for a smoother experience and enhanced security.
- **Optimize Performance:** Use load balancers and scalable cloud resources to handle peak traffic during registration and login.

   - User uploads a resume.
   - AI parses the resume and structures it into S.M.A.R.T goals.
   - Profile is anonymized.

2. **Employer Views Profile**
   - Can see skills and experience without identifiers.
   - If interested, unlocks the full profile to reveal identity.
   - Initiates communication via the platform.

**Limitations:**
- **Resume Parsing Accuracy:** AI may misinterpret complex formats.
- **Anonymization Precision:** Incomplete anonymization could leak personal details.
- **High-Volume Profiles:** Performance may degrade with numerous profiles.

**Flow Diagram:**
```
Candidate -> Upload Resume -> AI Parsing -> S.M.A.R.T Goal Structuring -> Anonymized Profile
Employer -> View Anonymized Profile -> Unlock Profile -> Initiate Contact
```

**Recommendations:**
- **Improve Parsing Algorithms:** Regularly train and fine-tune AI models using diverse resume formats to enhance parsing accuracy.
- **Robust Testing of Anonymization:** Perform comprehensive testing to ensure all personal identifiers are effectively removed or masked.
- **Optimize Data Processing:** Use cloud services for scalable processing power to handle high volumes of profiles.

   - Anomalies are flagged for review.

**Limitations:**
- **Data Accuracy:** Aggregation from multiple sources can lead to discrepancies.
- **Performance Impact:** Generating large reports in real-time can cause latency.
- **Data Privacy Compliance:** Handling sensitive demographic data requires strict protocols.

**Flow Diagram:**
```
Employer -> Select Metrics -> Generate Report -> Review -> Export/Save
Admin -> Dashboard -> Review System Health -> Anomaly Detection -> Action/Alert
```

**Recommendations:**
- **Data Validation Layers:** Implement data validation processes to check for consistency and accuracy before generating reports.
- **Scheduled Reports:** Offer scheduled report generation as an option to minimize real-time processing loads during peak usage.
- **Compliance Audits:** Regularly audit data handling practices to ensure compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
