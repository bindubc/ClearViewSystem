## **ClearView: Program Summary**

### **Overview:**
ClearView is a supplemental Human Resources (HR) platform that aims to promote equitable hiring by anonymizing candidate information and focusing on objective skills and qualifications. In addition to anonymization, it enables Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) consultants to observe interviews and evaluate the interviewer's approach, helping reduce unconscious biases.

### **Tagline:**
**Transparent Decision Making**

### **Key Problem Statements:**
1. **Lack of Impactful Metrics:** Traditional HR systems do not effectively identify or reduce potential biases in the hiring and interview processes.
2. **Redundant and Ineffective ATS Systems:** Current Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) fail to accurately match viable candidates with job descriptions, leading to missed opportunities for qualified professionals.

### **Technology Solution Description:**
ClearView leverages AI to transform candidate resumes into a S.M.A.R.T (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) goal format, aligning qualifications and experiences with the requirements of open roles. It hides personal identifiers until a candidate’s qualifications are objectively evaluated, ensuring an unbiased selection process. When a company chooses to unlock a profile, aggregated data points reveal any disparities in the hiring process, providing actionable insights.
