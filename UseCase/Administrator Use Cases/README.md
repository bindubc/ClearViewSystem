#### 2.8 CAP Consideration
- **Consistency**: Ensure all components read the same configuration values.
- **Availability**: Configuration service should be operational at all times.
- **Partition Tolerance**: Use a distributed architecture for the configuration service.

### 3. Use Case: Generate Reports

#### 3.1 ADR
- **Decision**: Use a reporting service to aggregate data for generating reports.
- **Rationale**: Separate reporting logic allows for optimized performance and scalability.

#### 3.2 API
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/reports`
  - **Request Parameters**:
    ```json
    {
      "reportType": "string",  // e.g., usage, performance
      "dateRange": "date"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**: Generated report data in JSON or PDF format.

#### 3.3 Characteristics
- **Automation**: Reports can be generated on a schedule or on-demand.
- **Detailed**: Reports provide insights into various metrics and KPIs.

#### 3.4 Data/Operation Flow
1. **Administrator** requests a report through the API.
2. **Reporting Service** processes the request and aggregates necessary data.
3. **Report Database** stores the generated report.

#### 3.5 Components Involved
- **API Gateway**
- **Reporting Service**
- **Data Warehouse/Report Database**

#### 3.6 Storage Estimation
- **Storage Requirement**: Approximately 2 MB per report. For 100 reports = 200 MB.
