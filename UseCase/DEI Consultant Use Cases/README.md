#### 1.5 Components Involved
- **API Gateway**
- **Registration Service**
- **Consultant Database**

#### 1.6 Storage Estimation
- **Storage Requirement**: Approximately 100 KB per consultant profile (name, email, hashed password, organization) for 1000 consultants = 100 MB.

#### 1.7 Failover Considerations

#### 2.8 CAP Consideration
- **Consistency**: All recordings must be accessible immediately after the interview.
- **Availability**: Ensure recording service is available during interviews.
- **Partition Tolerance**: Use a microservices architecture to prevent service failures.

### 3. Use Case: Submit Interview Evaluations

#### 3.1 ADR
- **Decision**: Use structured forms for evaluations to standardize feedback.
- **Rationale**: Consistency in feedback ensures fair comparisons.

#### 3.2 API
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/interviews/evaluate`
  - **Request Body**: 
    ```json
    {
      "interviewId": "string",
      "consultantId": "string",
      "rating": "integer",
      "comments": "string"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**: Confirmation of feedback submission.

#### 3.3 Characteristics
- **Standardization**: Predefined rating scales and comments.
- **Feedback Loop**: Notifications to interviewers regarding evaluations.

#### 3.4 Data/Operation Flow

2. **Evaluation Service** processes the feedback.
3. **Feedback Database** stores the evaluation.

#### 3.5 Components Involved
- **API Gateway**
- **Evaluation Service**
- **Feedback Database**

#### 3.6 Storage Estimation
- **Storage Requirement**: Approximately 10 KB per evaluation. For 100 evaluations = 1 MB.

#### 3.7 Failover Considerations
- Implement logging for feedback submissions to prevent data loss.

#### 3.8 CAP Consideration
- **Consistency**: Ensure all evaluations are visible to relevant parties immediately.
- **Availability**: The evaluation service should be available post-interview.
- **Partition Tolerance**: Use eventual consistency for feedback visibility.

### 4. Use Case: Generate Bias Reports

#### 4.1 ADR
- **Decision**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze feedback for bias detection.
- **Rationale**: Data-driven insights are essential for identifying patterns of bias.

#### 4.2 API
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/reports/bias`
  - **Request Parameters**: 
    ```json
    {
      "consultantId": "string",
      "dateRange": "date"
    }
    ```
