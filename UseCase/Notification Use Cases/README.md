Let’s dive deeper into the **Notification Use Cases** for the DEI Consultant platform. This will include detailed Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), API specifications, characteristics, data/operation flows, components involved, storage estimations, failover considerations, and CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) considerations.

### Notification Use Cases Overview

1. **Send Notification to Candidates**: Notify candidates about application status updates.
2. **Send Notification to Employers**: Inform employers about new candidates or application statuses.
3. **Send Reminder Notifications**: Remind users about important tasks or events (e.g., interview dates).
4. **Bulk Notifications**: Send notifications to multiple users at once.

---

### 1. Use Case: Send Notification to Candidates

#### 1.1 ADR
- **Decision**: Use a centralized notification service to handle all candidate notifications.
- **Rationale**: Centralization improves maintainability and scalability of notification management.

#### 1.2 API
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/notifications/send`
  - **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "recipient": {
      "type": "candidate", // Candidate type
      "id": "string" // Unique identifier for the candidate
    },
    "message": "string", // Notification message
    "type": "email" // Type of notification (e.g., email, SMS, push)
  }
  ```
  - **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "notificationId": "string"
  }
  ```

#### 1.3 Characteristics
- **Personalization**: Notifications should be personalized based on the recipient’s profile.
- **Multi-channel Support**: Notifications can be sent via email, SMS, or push notifications.

#### 1.4 Data/Operation Flow
1. **User Action** triggers the need for a notification (e.g., application status change).
2. The **Notification Service** receives the request through the API.
3. The service processes the request, formats the message, and queues it for sending.
4. The **Messaging Queue** manages the sending process to ensure reliability.
5. The notification is sent to the candidate through the chosen channel.

#### 1.5 Components Involved
- **API Gateway**
- **Notification Service**
- **Messaging Queue** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- **Email/SMS Gateway**

#### 1.6 Storage Estimation
- Each notification record (including metadata) is approximately 500 bytes.
- For 10,000 notifications: 
  \[
  \text{Storage} = 10,000 \times 500 \text{ bytes} = 5 \text{ MB}
  \]

#### 1.7 Failover Considerations
- Implement message persistence in the messaging queue to prevent data loss during failures.
- Use a fallback mechanism to retry sending failed notifications after a predefined delay.

#### 1.8 CAP Consideration
- **Consistency**: Ensure that notifications are sent only once and track their status.
- **Availability**: The notification service should be available to process requests at all times.
- **Partition Tolerance**: Use asynchronous processing to handle network partitions gracefully.

### 2. Use Case: Send Notification to Employers

#### 2.1 ADR
- **Decision**: Leverage the same notification service for employer notifications.
- **Rationale**: Reusing the notification service promotes consistency and reduces complexity.

#### 2.2 API
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/notifications/send`
  - **Request Body** (similar to candidates, just change the recipient type):
  ```json
  {
    "recipient": {
      "type": "employer", // Employer type
      "id": "string" // Unique identifier for the employer
    },
    "message": "string",
    "type": "email"
  }
  ```

#### 2.3 Characteristics
- **Targeted Messaging**: Notifications tailored to the employer’s needs (e.g., candidate updates).
- **Timeliness**: Ensure notifications are sent in real-time or near real-time.

#### 2.4 Data/Operation Flow
1. The **HR System** triggers an event (e.g., new candidate applies).
2. The **Notification Service** receives the request to notify the employer.
3. The message is formatted and sent to the **Messaging Queue**.
4. The notification is dispatched to the employer’s preferred channel.

#### 2.5 Components Involved
- Same components as in the previous use case.

#### 2.6 Storage Estimation
- Similar storage estimation as the candidate notifications: approximately 5 MB for 10,000 notifications.

#### 2.7 Failover Considerations
- Use retries for failed notification deliveries with exponential backoff.

#### 2.8 CAP Consideration
- **Consistency**: Ensure the notification accurately reflects the status of candidates.
- **Availability**: Maintain high availability of the notification service.
- **Partition Tolerance**: Allow for message queuing during network issues.

### 3. Use Case: Send Reminder Notifications

#### 3.1 ADR
- **Decision**: Implement scheduled jobs for sending reminder notifications.
- **Rationale**: Scheduling improves user engagement by reminding them of upcoming events.

#### 3.2 API
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/notifications/reminder`
  - **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "recipient": {
      "type": "string", // candidate or employer
      "id": "string"
    },
    "message": "string",
    "reminderTime": "ISODateTime" // Scheduled time for the reminder
  }
  ```

#### 3.3 Characteristics
- **Flexibility**: Ability to set reminders for different types of events.
- **User-configurable**: Allow users to specify their reminder preferences.

#### 3.4 Data/Operation Flow
1. A reminder is scheduled by the user via the UI.
2. The **Reminder Service** stores the reminder request.
3. At the scheduled time, the **Notification Service** retrieves and sends the reminder.

#### 3.5 Components Involved
- **API Gateway**
- **Reminder Service**
- **Notification Service**
- **Scheduler** (e.g., cron jobs, Quartz Scheduler)

#### 3.6 Storage Estimation
- Each reminder record is approximately 300 bytes.
- For 10,000 reminders: 
  \[
  \text{Storage} = 10,000 \times 300 \text{ bytes} = 3 \text{ MB}
  \]

#### 3.7 Failover Considerations
- Store reminders in a durable database to prevent loss.
- Implement a logging mechanism for failed reminder deliveries.

#### 3.8 CAP Consideration
- **Consistency**: Ensure reminders are sent as scheduled.
- **Availability**: The reminder service must be operational to handle scheduled tasks.
- **Partition Tolerance**: Handle reminder processing through queued tasks during outages.

### 4. Use Case: Bulk Notifications

#### 4.1 ADR
- **Decision**: Use batch processing for sending bulk notifications.
- **Rationale**: Improves performance and reduces the load on messaging services.

#### 4.2 API
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/notifications/bulk`
  - **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "recipients": [
      {
        "type": "candidate", // or employer
        "id": "string"
      }
    ],
    "message": "string",
    "type": "email"
  }
  ```

#### 4.3 Characteristics
- **Efficiency**: Process and send notifications in batches.
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect the limits of third-party services to avoid overloading them.

#### 4.4 Data/Operation Flow
1. The **Admin Panel** triggers a bulk notification.
2. The **Notification Service** gathers the recipients and prepares messages.
3. Messages are sent in batches through the **Messaging Queue**.
4. Each notification is processed, and success/failure is logged.

#### 4.5 Components Involved
- Same components as previous use cases.

#### 4.6 Storage Estimation
- Similar storage requirement as regular notifications, but optimized through batch processing.

#### 4.7 Failover Considerations
- Implement logging and retry mechanisms for failed batch deliveries.

#### 4.8 CAP Consideration
- **Consistency**: Ensure all recipients receive the same message.
- **Availability**: The system must be available for bulk operations.
- **Partition Tolerance**: Manage bulk operations through queued processes to handle failures gracefully.
