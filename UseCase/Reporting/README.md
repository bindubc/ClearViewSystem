  \[
  \text{Total Storage} = 1,000 \times 500 \text{ KB} = 500 \text{ MB}
  \]

#### Failover Considerations:
- Implement **database replication** to ensure data integrity and availability in case of failure.

#### CAP Considerations:
- **Consistency**: Ensure analytics are based on the latest data.
- **Availability**: Provide continuous access to analytics for employers.
- **Partition Tolerance**: Design for operational continuity during network partitions.

#### Storage Estimation:
- **Metrics Storage**: Each metric may take 200 KB. For 1,000 metrics:
  \[
  \text{Total Storage} = 1,000 \times 200 \text{ KB} = 200 \text{ MB}
  \]

#### Failover Considerations:
- Use **caching mechanisms** to store recent metrics temporarily during outages.

#### CAP Considerations:
- **Consistency**: Critical for ensuring metrics are reflective of the latest data.
- **Availability**: Important for stakeholders needing timely insights.
- **Partition Tolerance**: Must function without data loss during partitions.
